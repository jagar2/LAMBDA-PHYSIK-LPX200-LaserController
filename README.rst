LPX 200 Laser Controller
========================

**LPX 200 Laser Controller** is a Python-based application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to control the Lambda Physik LPX 200 Laser. It allows users to poll the system status, execute commands, and log energy readings from the laser system into an SQLite database.

Features
--------

- **Automatic Serial Port Detection**: Automatically finds and connects to the correct serial port where the laser is connected.
- **Control Laser Operations**: Perform operations like starting, stopping, and setting laser parameters such as voltage and energy.
- **Real-time Status Polling**: The GUI continuously polls and updates the laser status every second.
- **Energy Logging**: Automatically logs energy data into an SQLite database when the laser is active.
- **PyQt5 Interface**: A PyQt5-based user interface for ease of use.

Installation
------------
1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/m3-learning/LAMBDA-PHYSIK-LPX200-LaserController.git
      cd LAMBDA-PHYSIK-LPX200-LaserController

2. **Install the package**:

   Use the following command to install the package along with its dependencies. This will install the `lpx200` package in editable mode (useful for development and modifications):

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .

3. **Verify installation**:

   After installation, verify that the package is installed correctly by listing the installed packages:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip list

   You should see `lpx200` listed as an installed package.


Initializing the Laser Controller GUI
=====================================

To start the Lambda Physik LPX 200 laser controller GUI, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the script to initialize the GUI:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python src/lpx/LPX200.py

3. The GUI will open, displaying various buttons and text areas for controlling and monitoring the laser. Below is an image of the initial GUI interface:

.. image:: images/laser_controller_initial_gui.png
   :alt: Initial Laser Controller GUI
   :width: 500px

* The "Laser Status" section displays the current mode, repetition rate, high voltage, energy, and pressure.
* The "Command Entry" section allows you to enter commands, while the "Responses" section shows feedback from the laser controller.
* Various buttons are available for controlling different aspects of the laser system (e.g., `RUN STOP`, `MODE`, `HV`, etc.).

Once the GUI is open, you can use the buttons to control the laser and monitor its status.


The program will automatically detect the correct serial port that the laser is connected to and establish communication. Once started, you can interact with the laser via the buttons and commands provided in the interface.


Control Commands
